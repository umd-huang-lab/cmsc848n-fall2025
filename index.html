    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
          This course dives into the cutting edge of <strong>generative AI agents</strong>&mdash;autonomous systems powered by large language and vision models that can reason, plan, and act in complex environments. Students will study both the theoretical foundations and practical techniques behind these systems, drawing from the latest research and industry applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          We begin by establishing a foundation in modern generative AI, then progressively explore advanced capabilities that enable agents to function as intelligent collaborators. Core topics include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Reasoning and Planning</strong> &mdash; techniques for multi-step reasoning, strategy formulation, and decision-making.</li>
          <li><strong>Tool Use and APIs</strong> &mdash; how agents interface with external resources, from databases to software tools.</li>
          <li><strong>Memory and Context Management</strong> &mdash; mechanisms that allow agents to store, retrieve, and update knowledge.</li>
          <li><strong>Multi-step and Multi-modal Interaction</strong> &mdash; enabling agents to coordinate across language, images, and structured data.</li>
          <li><strong>Evaluation and Alignment</strong> &mdash; assessing reliability, safety, and performance of agents in real-world tasks.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Hands-on projects</strong> are central to the course. Students will incrementally design, implement, and evaluate their own generative AI agents, culminating in a final project where teams build agents capable of tackling open-ended, practical challenges.
        </p>
        <p>By the end of the course, students will:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Understand the technical underpinnings of generative AI agents.</li>
          <li>Gain practical skills in developing agents with reasoning, memory, and tool-use capabilities.</li>
          <li>Critically analyze the opportunities and limitations of agent systems in research and industry.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
        <p>
          This course is intended for advanced undergraduates and graduate students with a b interest in artificial intelligence and machine learning. To succeed, students are expected to have:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Programming proficiency in Python</strong>, including experience with libraries such as NumPy and PyTorch (or TensorFlow).</li>
          <li><strong>Machine Learning fundamentals</strong>, including supervised and unsupervised learning, neural networks, and model evaluation.</li>
          <li>Prior coursework in <strong>deep learning</strong> (e.g., sequence models, attention mechanisms) is recommended but not strictly required.</li>
          <li>Familiarity with software engineering practices (version control, debugging, modular coding) will be helpful for project work.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Students who have taken introductory AI or machine learning courses will be well-prepared. A background in natural language processing or computer vision is a plus but not required&mdash;these concepts will be introduced as needed.
        </p>

    <h3>Grading</h3>
        <p>The purpose of assignments & grading is to provide extra incentive to help you keep up with the material and assess how well you understand it, so that you have a solid background in machine learning by the end of the semester.</p>

        <p>I expect students to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Come to class prepared, having completed the assigned readings.</li>
          <li>Complete the assigned weekly homework assignments before class, and be prepared to discuss their solution in class.</li>
          <li>Participate actively in discussions both in person and online.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Your grade will be based on:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Homeworks (20%). </strong>There will be roughly one homework per week released on Canvas. Each is worth 1 to 2% of your final grade, depending on its length. The weights will be marked accordingly. Homeworks that are not autograded will be graded on a high-pass (100%), low-pass (50%) or fail (0%) basis. These are to be completed individually.</li>
            <li><strong>Programming projects (30%). </strong>There are three programming projects, each worth 10% of your final grade. You will be graded on both code correctness as well as your analysis of the results. These must be completed in teams of two or three students.</li>
            <li><strong>Midterm exam (20%). </strong>There will be an in-class midterm exam, obviously to be completed individually. You may bring one sheet of notes.</li>
            <li><strong>Final exam (30%). </strong>There will be a (cumulative) final exam, during the official slot, to be completed individually. You may bring one sheet of notes.</li>
          </ul>
    

    <h3>Communication and Discussion</h3>
        <p>We will be using Piazza for class-related discussion and communication. The system is highly catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from classmates, the TA, and myself. Rather than emailing questions to the teaching staff, please post your questions on Piazza (either as public discussions or as private posts to instructors). All messages sent to the instructors email addresses will be redirected to Piazza.<br />
