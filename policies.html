  <h1>Class Policies</h1>

  <h3>Participation & Modality</h3>
  <p>
    This is an interactive, research-oriented course. Lectures will include instructor-led presentations, Q&amp;A,
    and breakout discussions; occasional impromptu in-class quizzes check engagement and understanding. 
    TA-led Q&amp;A sessions and an official Slack space support asynchronous questions and office hours.
  </p>

  <h3>Teamwork & Projects</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Projects are team-based (up to 3 students). Form teams early and collaborate professionally:
      be responsive, responsible, punctual, supportive, and communicative.</li>
    <li>Use the instructor-provided catalog of project topics (strongly recommended). Proposing your own topic is possible
      only if it is highly relevant to course themes and approved by the instructor.</li>
    <li>Expect to iterate: research involves false starts. Be critical, creative, open-minded, and prepared to revise approaches.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Late Work (Late Bank)</h3>
  <p>
    A shared <strong>72-hour late bank</strong> applies to all deliverables with due dates (e.g., homework and written reports).
    You may allocate these hours across the semester at your discretion. The late bank 
    <strong>does not</strong> apply to in-person exams, presentations, or other live assessments.
    Once the 72-hour bank is exhausted, late submissions are not accepted. Use wisely.
  </p>

  <h3>Communication</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Announcements, clarifications, and logistics will be posted to Slack and/or ELMS. Check regularly.</li>
    <li>Use Slack for asynchronous questions; attend TA-led Q&amp;A for technical and project support.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Attendance & Excused Absences</h3>
  <p>
    Active participation is expected. For excused absences, follow university guidance. For short, medically
    necessitated absences, notify the instructor as soon as possible and provide appropriate documentation if required.
    Major graded events (e.g., live presentations) require official documentation for accommodation.
  </p>


  <h3>Academic Integrity</h3>
  <p>
    Adhere to the University’s Code of Academic Integrity and acceptable use of computing resources.
    All submitted work must be your team’s own unless explicitly permitted. Discussing high-level ideas is encouraged;
    copying solutions (or allowing others to copy yours) is cheating.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Clearly cite any external code, models, datasets, or tools you use. Do not post solutions or project code publicly.</li>
    <li>During any individual assessment, collaboration is prohibited.</li>
    <li>Violations may be referred to the Student Honor Council and can result in severe penalties.</li>
  </ul>


  <h3>Accessibility & Disability Support</h3>
  <p>
    Students who need academic accommodations should contact the Office of Disability Support Services (DSS)
    and share their accommodation letter with the instructor as early as possible so arrangements can be made.
  </p>

  <h3>Inclusive Conduct & Anti-Harassment</h3>
  <p>
    We are committed to a respectful, inclusive learning environment. Harassment or hostile behavior is not tolerated,
    including conduct based on race, gender, religion, age, color, national origin, ancestry, disability, sexual orientation,
    or gender identity. If you experience or witness harassment, contact the instructor or department staff.
  </p>

  <h3>Grading & Deadlines</h3>
  <p>
    Detailed grading breakdowns and all dates (e.g., quiz usage, homework deadlines, midterm/final report submissions,
    and presentation windows) are listed on the 
    <a href="assessments.html">Assessments</a> and <a href="schedule.html">Schedule</a> pages to avoid duplication.
